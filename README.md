## Experimenting with some simple 2d shapes on the p5.js web editor.
This week I was catching up with a weeks worth of work I had missed.

### Following workshop 
Following the pseudocode instructions I had made during the first live class I made a simplified bird using two arcs.

I found it difficult to get the arcs to join as I couldn't figure out how to see the coordinates on the canvas, so I just got them to connect by experimenting with different numbers.

### Some more sketchiing

Next I tried to create a more complex image using more shapes.

I found some code online (https://editor.p5js.org/prewiredonline/sketches/mA6XRFf-G) that showed the position of the cursor on the canvas.
It looked like this in their website:

I copied a piece of their code and added it to my sketch:

Which looked like this:

<img width="158" alt="coords" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ff6f155-4c50-4c50-b040-f3c4af8a92d6" />

I did not find the result to be very appealing but it helped me get a better idea of how the web editor worked.

I'd never had any previous experience creating images via instructions so I found it difficult and frustrating to try and translate what was in my head onto the screen using a language I did not feel confident in. 
I think I want to experiment futher by adding movement, and using solid shapes.
